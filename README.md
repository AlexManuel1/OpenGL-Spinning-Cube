# What I Learned

* basics of OpenGL such as creating shaders and meshes (VAOs, VBOs, and IBOs)
* used GLFW to handle events such as keyboard input for translating, rotating, and scaling meshes.
* created and edited vertex and fragment shaders which solidified a better understanding of the rendering pipeline

## How to run program

* Optional: install GLEW and GLFW on mac using brew. 
* edit the make file so that you have access to the GLEW and GLFW library and header files. 
* run the bash script (run.sh)

## keyboard controls

* UP ARROW/DOWN ARROW: rotate about X axis
* LEFT ARROW/RIGHT ARROW: rotate about Y axis
* W/S: move about Z axis (move forward/backward)
* Q/E: move about Y axis (move up/down)
* A/D: move about X axis (move right/left)
